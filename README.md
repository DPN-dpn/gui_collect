# Collect Script with GUI
## WORK IN PROGRESS

Used to extract model data from 3dmigoto generated frame dumps for certain anime games.

## Requirements
- **Python >= 3.9**
- texconv.exe (included in modules directory)

> [!WARNING]
> texconv.exe is used to convert .dds file types, and is included in the modules directory. If you're concerned about having an unknown .exe bundled in which is a very valid concern, feel free to delete it and grab it yourself from Microsoft DirectX's official repo here https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/releases/tag/jun2024

## How to run

Dowload zip and extract. Either double click `launch.bat` to automatically find the latest python version available and run the app using it or manually run `collect.py` with python. Releases will be available later...
