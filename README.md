# Collect Script with GUI

Used to extract model data from 3dmigoto generated frame dumps for certain anime games. Check out [3DMigoto Hunting & Dumping Tutorial](https://leotorrez.github.io/modding/guides/hunting) for a quick guide.

## Requirements
- **Python >= 3.9**
- texconv.exe (included in modules directory)
- texdiag.exe (included in modules directory)

> [!WARNING]
> texconv.exe and texdiag.exe are used to convert and inspect .dds file types, and are included in the modules directory. If you're concerned about having unknown .exe bundled in which is a very valid concern, feel free to delete and grab them yourself from Microsoft DirectX's official repo here https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/releases/tag/jun2024

## How to run

Dowload zip and extract. Either double click `launch.bat` to automatically find the latest python version available and run the app using it or manually run `collect.py` with python.
