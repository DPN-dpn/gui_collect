# Collect Script with GUI
## WORK IN PROGRESS

Used to extract model data from 3dmigoto generated frame dumps for certain anime games.

## Requirements
- **Python >= 3.9**
- texconv.exe (included in modules directory)
- texdiag.exe (included in modules directory)

> [!WARNING]
> texconv.exe and texdiag.exe are used to convert and inspect .dds file types, and are included in the modules directory. If you're concerned about having unknown .exes bundled in which is a very valid concern, feel free to delete the included .exes and grab them yourself from Microsoft DirectX's official repo here https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/releases/tag/jun2024

## How to run

Dowload zip and extract. Releases will be available later... Launch cmd/powershell
```
python collect.py
```
